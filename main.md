# David Joslin's Portfolio


## About Me
My name is David Joslin, and I am currently a student at Olathe Northwest High School studying cybersecurity. I am currently helping to lead the ONW CyberPatriot club as well as participating in the ONW TSA organization. Outside of school, I love to tinker with self-hosted applications which I (mainly temporarily) deploy in my home lab.

## Works

### Proxmox
I currently host and maintain my own instance of Proxmox, with which I host my entire home lab.
